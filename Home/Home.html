            <p>That is me to left</p>
            <p>My name is Christian Kruep. I am from the Bay Area and currently a senior at 
            Gonzaga University studying Computer Science with a minor in English and Writing. In my free time
            I enjoy reading, watching movies, playing rugby and weather permitting, swimming.

        <p>This whole thing is going to be under construction for quite some time. It should change and improve as I learn more about web development.</p>
        <p>I hope to progress this thing into the modern age and prevent it from stagnating and looking like something from the early 90's</p>
