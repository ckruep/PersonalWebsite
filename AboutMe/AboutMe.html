            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p> Hi! I'm Christian Kruep. I'm from the Bay Area and I recently just graduated from Gonzaga University where I was studying 
                Computer Science. I am currently hunkered down back home living and surviving while pursuing a career as a technical writer.
                Beyond that I enjoy spending my time reading, watching movies and Quakes games and, weather permitting, swimming. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This is my own personal website and I aim to keep adding to it over time, improving its quality and look. 
                I also have a column that I add to when I can.
            </p>
