            <p> I wrote the original draft of this list for my buddy Nick. He was looking for some book recommendations and I wrote it out.<br>
                The original list had more books on it and focused less on each book. I revised it by cutting out some books and fleshing out <br>
                why I recommended the books I did. These are mainly intended to be read for fun and leasure. <br>
                For the longest time I primarily only read Fantasy and Sci Fi so this list leans quite heavily, practically falling over, towards, <br>
                those genres, but I have been branching out recently into other genres. I may update this occasionally, knocking some off and adding new ones.</p>
