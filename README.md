<br>

christiankruep.com is my own personal website. This version of the site is all handmade, written by myself in cutting edge of HTML and CSS. Currently it features an About Me page, a column that I update periodically and a photo gallery. I aim to update the sites design as I learn more about web development.

Currently the webiste is hosted using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3</a>.
