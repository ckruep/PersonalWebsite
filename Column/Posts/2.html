                <h1>Some Good Books to Read</h1>

                <p><b id="big-letter">I</b> wrote the original draft of this list for my buddy Nick. 
                He was looking for some book recommendations and I wrote it out.
                The original list had more books on it and focused less on each book. 
                I revised it by cutting out some books and fleshing out
                why I recommended the books I did. These are mainly intended to be read for fun and leasure.
                For the longest time I primarily only read Fantasy and Sci Fi so this list leans quite heavily, 
                practically falling over, towards those genres, but I have been branching out recently. 
                I may update this occasionally, knocking some off and adding new ones.</p>
                

                <i> <br> <b>Note:</b> These books are not recommended in any particular order <br></i>

                <h3><br>Neuromancer by William Gibson</h3>
                <p>I like this one a lot. This is the seminal Cyberpunk novel. Set in a washed out, bleak looking future you follow Case, 
                    a washed-up console cowboy hacker who gets hired for a mysterious job involving an unknown patron. 
                    The world that Gibson creates is interesting to discover and explore, seeing how things have 
                    changed or stayed the same compared to ours. The writing style is unique. As a whole 
                    Neuromancer reads like an old noir book and I love it. Neuromancer is also responsible 
                    for coming up with the words cyberspace, matrix and a few others. This is a 
                    classic, and every time I read it, I enjoy it even more. The story, the writing style everything about it. 
                    It’s first of a trilogy called the Sprawl Trilogy and are complemented with a 
                    collection of short stories called Burning Chrome. If there was any book on this list, 
                    I would read first this one would be it.
                </p>

                <h3>Snowcrash by Neal Stephenson</h3>
                <p> I am a sucker for Cyberpunk what can I say. This one while being Cyberpunk lampoons 
                    the genre. Follow Hiro Protagonist, self-styled “Last of The Freelance Hackers” 
                    as he lives his life in an alternate 1990’s Los Angeles. My favorite part of this book 
                    is the world that Stephenson constructed that can be wonky at times with 90’s 
                    EXTREMENESS turned up to 11. Society exists in this weird balance of anarchy 
                    and extreme capitalism where a majority of organizations have turned into 
                    corporations including the Mafia and organized Religion. There exists a virtual 
                    reality world called the Metaverse that replaced the internet. This is a fun 
                    book that has great sense of humor. It’s very tongue and cheek and a has a type 
                    writing that adds up to a rollicking thriller. At times though it can be exposition 
                    heavy. I would recommend reading the first chapter and if you like it keep reading 
                    and if not don’t. This probably the best book to read by Stephenson as an 
                    introduction of his work. </p>
                
                <h3>Guards! Guards! by Sir Terry Pratchett</h3>
                <p>I didn’t start reading Pratchett until I was a senior in high school, but he 
                    has quickly become one of my favorite authors. This book is the first in the 
                    Watch storyline of Discworld. Accompany Sam Vimes and the City Watch of Ankh-Morpork 
                    as they attempt to thwart a mysterious plot intending to overthrow the Patrician, 
                    the Ruler of the city. A cleverly written book, Guards! Guards! Is funny as can be 
                    with and is a good introduction into Pratchett. A classic fantasy novel that pokes 
                    fun at some of the tropes of the genre. GNU Terry Pratchett</p>
                
                
                <h3>A Long Way To A Small Angry Planet by Becky Chambers</h3>
                <p>A Sci Fi slice of life about a ship that bores through space to create wormholes. 
                    Contains a colorful cast of characters coming from different backgrounds and 
                    varying species. This book isn’t to plot heavy but more focused on its characters 
                    and their experiences as they live their lives aboard the Wayfarer, trying to keep 
                    the old tub running. This a cozy read, being fun and enjoyable. If you’re looking 
                    or a lighthearted read to enjoy with a cup of tea this is it. There are 2 other 
                    books in the wayfarer series right now.</p>
                
                <h3>Good Omens by Sir Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman</h3>
                <p>Heaven and Hell do exist on Earth and they are gearing up for Armageddon. The book 
                    deals with the aftermath of when a demon accidentally misplaces and loses track of 
                    the Anti-Christ, which causes him to grow up human and the consequences of it. 
                    This is one of the funniest books I have read in my life. It is witty and satirical 
                    in its humor. A combination of both Pratchett and Gaiman make for a solid, quality 
                    novel that combines the two writing styles of each author seamlessly. I love this 
                    book more and more each time I read it. This one is one of my favorites of 
                    favorites.</p>
                
                <h3>Kings of the Wyld by Nicholas Eames</h3>
                <p>A story about getting the band back together, but instead of being musicians trying 
                    to save an orphanage it’s about reassembling a long broken up group of mercenaries 
                    with the intention of saving the front man’s daughter from death. This book really 
                    is about getting the band back together but takes place when they’re middle aged 
                    dudes long past their prime, where the legends about them have long overshadowed 
                    their true selves. A fun read that builds an interesting world with monsters, 
                    decaying ruins and enjoyable characters. Easily quotable and memorable. 
                    Directly inspired by classic rock and roll, Eames even lists what songs inspired 
                    what chapters and certain characters on his website as the official unofficial 
                    soundtrack for the book.</p>
                
                <h3>Dune by Frank Herbert</h3>
                <p>If you love world building this is book for you. Set way into the future where an 
                    interstellar empire rules all. The operation of society is dependent on a drug 
                    called “spice” that extends human life, increases mental capabilities, but 
                    most importantly allows interstellar flight to happen as the pilots need it to 
                    navigate through the stars. Spice can only be found on one planet Dune, also 
                    known as Arrakis a very inhospitable desert planet. Follow Paul Atreides as 
                    his family gains control of Arrakis and deal with the strings come attached. 
                    The whole books is a massive intertwined web of plot, politics, and backstabbing. 
                    It’s a complex book with a good narrative and chunky with information. I’m pretty 
                    sure the first half exists to set up the second half. A seminal classic that is 
                    detailed in its world building and story. </p>
                
                <h3>The Black Company by Glen Cook</h3>
                <p>This one is a bit grittier and darker as fantasy goes. Your dropped in following 
                    Croaker, the doctor and historian of a mercenary group called the Black Company. 
                    Right at the start of the book the Black Company signs on into service to the 
                    mysterious Lady and start moving north to fight in her wars. Told in a first-person 
                    view, reads like a journal of Croakers as he tells his account of events. Croaker 
                    along with the rest of the Black Company are some ok dudes fighting for what in 
                    other books would be the Big Bad. No black and white morality here a lot of grey 
                    thrown around. Interesting read that tells a solid tale.</p>
