                <h1>Random Obscure Websites</h1>
                <h4>April 1st, 2020</h4>
            </div>

            <div id="column-content">
                <p><b id="big-letter">T</b>o me, the Internet shares a lot of similarities with an ocean. 
                    As humans we generally don’t know much about what is going on underneath an ocean’s surface, 
                    only having mapped around 20% of what is going on down there. The Internet shares this same quality. 
                    Google, Amazon, and Netflix, sites like those are the equivalent of being up near the surface, easier 
                    to find and heavier with traffic. But as you go further down the less visited sites become, 
                    and eventually, they inhabit their own little pocket of existence.</p>

                <p>I love coming across smaller websites, ones that are niche in purpose, completely bizarre and just fun to 
                    poke around on. For the most part I never stumble across such websites randomly. 
                    Usually I get pointed in their direction by finding mentions of them on other sites and when 
                    I do happen upon a website that I enjoy or am intrigued by, I tend to bookmark them for future inspection. 
                    Over time I have built up a list of websites that I have bookmarked, nothing substantial 
                    but an interesting log of some of the more memorable websites I have come across surfing the Internet.</p>

                <p>The site that started me taking note of peculiar sites was the one I talked about in my last post the 
                    <a href="https://mads.thescore.com/rayhudsonsoundboard">Ray Hudson soundboard</a>. 
                    As the domain name says it is a soundboard based around Ray Hudson a European Soccer announcer 
                    who has some funny quotes. I like it, it’s fun and I’m not really sure why it exists but yet it 
                    does occupy some space in the ether of the Internet just existing. </p>

                <p>A fragment of the earlier days of the web that I have bookmarked is the 
                    <a href="http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html">Evil Overlord List</a>. 
                    The website serves as a list of safety measures and failsafe’s the site’s creator 
                    would enact in the event of becoming an evil overlord or James bond type villain. 
                    My personal favorite from it is #12, “One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. 
                    Any flaws in my plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before implementation.” 
                    Honestly that makes sense and the rest of the site contains other pearls of wisdom. 
                    Beyond the sensible overlord advice my favorite aspect of the site is the fact that 
                    it hasn’t been updated for years. It has this intangible patina to it that I find beautiful.</p>

                <p>Some of the sites I have bookmarked are incredibly niche, used to convey an extremely specific piece 
                    of information. There’s <a href="https://diddukewin.com/">Diddukewin.com</a>
                    which as it says, whether or not, the Duke men’s basketball team won their most recent game. 
                    There is iscaliforniaonfire.com (http://iscaliforniaonfire.com/) which says either yes or no 
                    if California is on fire (I’ve never seen it not say no) and <a href="https://riseandshout.net/">
                    riseandshout.net</a> which is a counter for how long since BYU beat Utah in football. 
                    I love how they just exist almost as a joke.</p>
                
                <p>A unique website I recently came across is <a href="https://userinyerface.com/">userinyerface.com </a>, 
                    a website designed with a purposefully terrible UI. I think the site is a good teaching tool. 
                    It highlights good web design contrasting it with intentionally atrocious design. 
                    By doing so it makes you stop and think about how to interact with the site because your 
                    expectations of how to interact with a website have been deliberately turned on their ear. 
                    Playing with userinyerface is almost like trying to piece together a puzzle with a person who 
                    keeps putting pieces in the wrong spot and speaks very literally when you confront them about it.</p>
                
                <p>A couple of sites that I have bookmarked fall under the category of interactive art as 
                    there is no other way of really describing them properly. Take for instance 
                    <a href="https://www.windows93.net">windows93.net </a> a vaporwave version of windows 95 
                    with a host of applications and functions that can quickly turn into a fever dream of trippy 
                    visuals and bizarre sound bites. Another surreal one is <a href="https://superbad.com/">Superbad.com</a>. 
                    It is not a website dedicated to the Seth Rogen movie, instead it is… Well I’m not sure exactly what it is. 
                    It's a weird maze-like website that continues to unfold as you go deeper and deeper into leaving you 
                    more and more confused as to who created it and why. That is the problem with trying to describe 
                    some of the odder, more bizarre websites I have come across. I can try to relate what they are like 
                    and get a some of ideas across to you but to really experience it you have to see it for yourself. 
                </p>
                
                <p>The Internet is a host to a lot of small and odd websites. They are pocketed throughout 
                    it waiting to be discovered. They are fun to find and explore as they really show off the 
                    creativity or bizarreness of their creators. It is always a grand old time surfing the web. </p>
