                <h1>Graduating In The Age of Solitude</h1>
                <h4>October 8th, 2020</h4>

            <div id="column-content">
                <p><b id="big-letter">A</b> month ago, I attended my college graduation.
                    That’s a fairly typical thing for a college senior to do; attend their own graduation.
                    I made sure to get up early, eat a big breakfast and get all dressed up in my cap and gown.
                    I was even was a bit early as to make sure I didn’t miss anything. There was one difference with my graduation.
                    It was completely virtual. </p>

                <p>Whether or not my graduation was going to happen had been up in the air since the first
                   stages of the lockdown in March. At first it was postponed from its original date in May to a
                   possible in person ceremony in early September if Covid had calmed down during the summer months.
                   But in late July, like Jeff Bridges in Tron, my graduation got digitized and went virtual.
                </p>


                <p>
                    When I first heard the news, I was disappointed but not terribly so. There were/are bigger things going on in the world.
                    But once I heard that it was going virtual I kind of forgot about it. My graduation become something that I wasn’t paying attention to.
                    Its presence would rear its head occasionally, I would remember it was approaching, but then I would gradually forget about it for another week or two.
                    The build up that had surrounded it was gone. The excitement around it that I had been generating felt like an inflated balloon where the air had been let out in one big rush.
                    By the time my graduation did come around I was slightly looking forward to it, but by that time it had become something I would attend and once it was over,
                    I would get on with the rest of my day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, I did attend, as much as I could sitting on my couch 750 miles away from Gonzaga’s campus watching the ceremony on my TV.
                    I wasn’t alone in watching it. My sister was with me, in person and my parents, some aunts, uncles and family friends joined in watching and
                    communicating together via a large hodgepodge of a FaceTime call. Doing so made for a surreal yet lonely experience.
                    Not being lonely in the sense of being alone with no one around because I was with friends or family.
                    But lonely in the sense of a loss of the shared camaraderie. I was separated from my fellow Zags. Each of us was graduating in our own insulated,
                    compartmentalized ceremony. I did chat with friends and fellow classmates via text during the ceremony but the lack of having a in person graduation,
                    being surrounded by fellow Zags celebrating the culmination of four(+) years of work made for an odd experience.
                </p>


                <p>
                    As for the graduation itself, virtual or otherwise, it was alright. It was a prerecorded video that was livestreamed and
                    had all the usual beats that a graduation had. Some ceremonial music played, people gave some speeches. The usual.
                    There was even a surprise congratulations from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=W_1k_p1M63g&feature=emb_title">Jimmy Kimmel</a>.
                    As for my diploma it was shipped to me, arriving a few days before the ceremony in a celebration kit from Gonzaga that contained a few other objects you would get from a graduation:
                    leather diploma case, commencement program, a sticker or two and a commemorative “Go Zags!” poster.
                    I did get to hear my name read aloud. It was read along with a whole heap of others in a multi hour video.
                    Instead of waiting for the speakers to work their way through the K’s I scrubbed ahead to where my name was and heard it get said.
                </p>

                <p>I really do appreciate the time and effort that Gonzaga put into making the virtual graduation happen. It required a great amount work to
                    be put in on their part and I am happy that they were able to put something together. I at least had the virtual commencement.
                    Friends I knew in other schools didn’t even get that. Their in-person graduation got the axe and that was that. I am thankful
                    I for the virtual ceremony even if it was a bit surreal. But at the same time, I was left wanting.  Even with watching the livestream,
                    receiving a celebration package from the school and wearing the cap and gown I wasn’t satisfied. I attended, “participated” and at the end
                    either through self-sabotage or because of extenuating circumstances I wasn’t fully satisfied. I did not come away from the it with a sense of
                    fulfillment or closure. But you know what. In the grand scheme of things, not having a in person graduation is not that big of a deal. I have had a
                    relatively smooth situation so far in 2020 and I am thankful I do not have it worse. Many people do and if having my graduation getting moved online is the
                    worst thing, I have personally encountered then I am fine with that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once again, I would like to thank those at Gonzaga University for the work and effort they put into the virtual graduation for my fellow classmates and me.
                    Even though I may gripe I do whole heartedly do appreciate their work and effort considering having the environment and time constraints that they have had to operate in.
                    Thank you, Gonzaga.
