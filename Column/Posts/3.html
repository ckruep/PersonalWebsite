            <div id="column-content">
                <p><b id="big-letter">I</b> made a <a href="https://ckruepsoundboard.firebaseapp.com/">soundboard</a>.I always wanted to and 
                    I finally did. It’s nothing too special. I made it back during my winter break when I was looking for something to do. 
                    I’ve always loved soundboards for some reason even though I know they can be a bit cheesy. 
                    I’ve always liked the idea of being able to conjure up a specific piece of audio on a whim depending on the situation. 
                    What mainly inspired me into creating my own soundboard was this <a href="https://mads.thescore.com/rayhudsonsoundboard">Ray Hudson one</a> I found. 
                    I can’t even remember where I found it, I’ve just had it bookmarked for years. I don’t even know much about Ray Hudson, 
                    except that he’s a European soccer commentator who can speak in some pretty damn funny metaphors. His soundboard I’m pretty sure has been 
                    forgotten by the Internet. I think it’s impossible to find it anymore without someone bringing you in on it. I bet even 
                    the devs who created it have forgotten about its existence. Knowing about it is the equivalent of being part of terrible club, 
                    that only you know about with the only benefits of being a member is that you get to make an Englishman say some funny stuff.</p>

                <p>Creating the soundboard was not that hard code wise. It’s mostly a hack job with minimal 
                    HTML and CSS with a little JavaScript thrown in. The main challenge I had with creating it was 
                    brainstorming up what soundbites to include and how to source them. I mostly just have clips from old 
                    sports broadcasts and interviews that were pulled from YouTube along with a peppering of some other stuff I find funny. 
                    As time goes I hope to keep adding more soundbites as I continue to find ones I like. </p>
